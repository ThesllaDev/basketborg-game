## 🎮 Gameplay

In each round, the exoskeleton analyzes the situation and presents the success chance of three possible actions:

Choose your move based on skill stats, strategic thinking and a touch of randomness.

## 🧠 Inspiration

This game was originally made for a game jam with the theme “Robot and Balance”, and challenges "Open Source" and "Build with Phaser". The theme of "robot and balance" is explored creatively: technology provides powerful support, but it’s not flawless. The game highlights how the balance between human skill and tech assistance is crucial — on the court and in real life.
